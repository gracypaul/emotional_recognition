Facial Emotion Recognition
This project demonstrates facial emotion recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python. The program can recognize emotions from facial images using the FER-2013 dataset.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
opencv-python
keras
tensorflow
scikit-learn
You can install them using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python keras tensorflow scikit-learn
Dataset
Download the FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle.

Place the fer2013.csv file in the same directory as the program files.

Usage
Run train_emotion_model.py to train the emotion recognition model:
bash
Copy code
python train_emotion_model.py
The trained model will be saved as emotion_model.h5.

Run emotion_recognition.py to start real-time facial emotion recognition using the webcam:
bash
Copy code
python emotion_recognition.py
Press q to exit the webcam window.

Model
The model is a CNN with layers for convolution, max-pooling, dropout, and fully connected (Dense) layers. It's compiled using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
